# Volumized Dev Environment (VS Code + Docker + OrbStack)

**Purpose:**  
This environment provides a **fully isolated development workspace** on macOS (Apple Silicon), using **Docker volumes** instead of host-mounted folders.  
Your host stays clean ‚Äî all source code, dependencies, and secrets (SSH/GPG) live **inside the container volume**.  
VS Code connects directly to the container using the **Dev Containers extension**.

---

## üß≠ Overview

The `volumized-dev` setup was designed to:

- Enable **clean, reproducible, and isolated** development environments.  
- Keep your **host filesystem untouched** (no node_modules, venvs, etc.).  
- Use **Docker volumes** instead of bind mounts for full separation.  
- Support **SSH & GPG integration** for secure Git operations.  
- Work seamlessly with **OrbStack** (fast, native Docker engine for macOS ARM).  
- Provide **VS Code integration** for editing, debugging, and terminals inside the container.

This makes it ideal for developers who want a **contained dev system** that can be rebuilt, backed up, and shared easily.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
- [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev) installed and running
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Extensions:
    - `Dev Containers` (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`)
    - Language/tool-specific extensions (Python, Node.js, Docker, etc.)
- Homebrew (for installing dependencies, if needed)
- GitHub or other Git remote (SSH recommended)

---

## üöÄ First-Time Setup

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jfheinrich-eu/volumized-dev.git
   cd volumized-dev
   ```

2. **Prepare environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit `.env` with your preferences.

3. **Run the orchestration script:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x initial_run.sh
   ./initial_run.sh
   ```

4. **Connect from VS Code:**
   - Command Palette ‚Üí ‚Äú**Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container‚Ä¶**‚Äù
   - Choose your container name
   - Open folder `/work`

---

## üíª Daily Workflow

1. **Start OrbStack** (if not already running).  
2. **Ensure container is running:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
3. **Attach VS Code:** open `/work`.  
4. **Develop as usual.**  
5. **Stop when done:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/stop_remove_container.sh
   ```
6. **Back up your volume (optional):**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/volume_backup.sh
   ```
