# Solution: Protected Branch Configuration Now Automatically Applied

## Problem

The configurations from `.github/settings.yml` for Protected Branch were not being executed because:

1. The `settings.yml` file was configured for the **Probot Settings App** (also known as **Repository Settings App**)
2. This GitHub App must be manually installed in the organization/repository
3. Without the app installation, the settings are not applied
4. The file alone does nothing - it's just a configuration file

## Solution

Instead of relying on an external GitHub App, a **GitHub Actions Workflow** was created that automatically applies the settings via the GitHub API.

### New Files

1. **`.github/workflows/sync-repo-settings.yml`** - The new workflow
2. **`docs/TestingSettingsSync.md`** - Testing instructions (English)
3. **`docs/SolutionProtectedBranch.md`** - This file

### Modified Files

1. **`.github/settings.yml`** - Updated header comment
2. **`.github/README.md`** - Updated documentation

## How Does the Solution Work?

The new workflow (`sync-repo-settings.yml`) is automatically executed when:

1. Changes to `.github/settings.yml` are pushed to the `main` branch
2. The workflow is manually triggered via the GitHub Actions UI

### What Does the Workflow Do?

The workflow applies three categories of settings:

#### 1. Repository Settings
- Description and homepage
- Features (Issues, Projects, Wiki)
- Merge options (Squash, Rebase)
- Branch deletion after merge

#### 2. Branch Protection Rules (main branch)
- Required number of reviews: **1**
- Code Owner reviews required: **Yes**
- Automatically dismiss stale reviews: **Yes**
- Status checks must pass: **Yes**
- Conversation resolution required: **Yes**
- Allow force pushes: **No**
- Allow branch deletion: **No**

#### 3. Labels
- Creates/updates all labels from settings.yml
- Including name, color, and description

## Benefits of the New Solution

✅ **No external app required** - Everything runs via GitHub Actions  
✅ **Automatic application** - With every push to settings.yml  
✅ **Immediate effect** - No waiting for app synchronization  
✅ **Full control** - Everything is in the repository code  
✅ **Audit trail** - All changes are visible in Actions  
✅ **Free** - Uses GitHub Actions (within free minutes)

## How to Use It?

### Automatic Usage

1. Make changes to `.github/settings.yml`
2. Commit and push to `main` branch
3. The workflow runs automatically
4. Settings are applied

### Manual Usage

1. Navigate to GitHub Actions
2. Select workflow "Sync Repository Settings"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch `main`
5. Confirm "Run workflow"

## Verification

After the workflow run, verify:

1. **Repository Settings** → General
   - Description and homepage correct?
   - Features enabled/disabled as desired?

2. **Repository Settings** → Branches → main
   - Branch protection rules active?
   - Required reviews: 1?
   - Code owners reviews required?

3. **Issues** → Labels
   - All labels present?
   - Colors correct?

## Important Notes

- The workflow requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically available)
- Minimum permission: `contents: read`
- Branch protection requires admin rights (automatic for workflows)
- The workflow is idempotent (multiple executions = same result)

## Next Steps

1. Merge the pull request
2. Run workflow manually or
3. Modify settings.yml and push
4. Verify that branch protection is active
